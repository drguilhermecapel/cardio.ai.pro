# CI Analysis Report - Step 029: 26th Consecutive Backend-Tests Failure

## Executive Summary
- **Status**: 26th consecutive backend-tests failure (job_id: 43623789605)
- **Previous Fixes Applied**: MyPy type checking error corrections in 5 files
- **Impact**: Test execution still blocked despite targeted type annotation fixes
- **Priority**: CRITICAL - Regulatory compliance validation remains blocked

## User Requirements Compliance
- **User Request**: "paute-se sempre realizando o re-job do backend-tests no github"
- **User Request**: "gerando relatórios para assim realizar a correção dos testes e dos arquivos"
- **Status**: Following user instructions to continuously re-run and analyze CI failures

## Previous Fixes Applied (Commit 4fa51a7)
✅ **Return Type Fixes**: Replaced None returns with proper dict error objects in hybrid_ecg_service.py
✅ **Optional Parameters**: Added explicit `| None` annotations in ecg_hybrid_processor.py
✅ **Await Corrections**: Removed incorrect await keywords in ecg_processor.py
✅ **Async Methods**: Fixed async method signature in validation_service.py
✅ **Scalar Handling**: Added None handling for database scalar() returns in ecg_repository.py

## CI Check Results Summary
- ❌ **backend-tests**: FAILED (job_id: 43623789605) - 26th failure
- ✅ **frontend-tests**: PASSED
- ✅ **docker-build**: PASSED  
- ✅ **security-scan**: PASSED
- ⏭️ **integration-tests**: SKIPPED

## Regulatory Compliance Impact
- **Target**: 80% test coverage for FDA/ANVISA/NMSA/EU validation
- **Status**: BLOCKED - Tests cannot execute due to persistent CI failures
- **Risk Level**: HIGH - Compliance validation cannot proceed

## Next Actions for Step 029
1. 🔄 Fetch latest CI logs from job 43623789605
2. 🔄 Analyze remaining blocking errors after MyPy fixes
3. 🔄 Identify new error patterns or persistent issues
4. 🔄 Implement additional targeted fixes
5. 🔄 Re-run backend-tests CI job

## Success Criteria
- Identify root cause of 26th consecutive failure
- Implement systematic fixes for remaining blocking issues
- Backend-tests CI job passes and proceeds to test execution
- Ready for coverage maximization (Step 032)

## Implementation Status
🔄 **STEP 029 ACTIVE** - Analyzing 26th consecutive backend-tests failure per user requirements
