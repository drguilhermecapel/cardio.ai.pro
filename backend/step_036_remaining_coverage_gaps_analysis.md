- **File**: `app/utils/ecg_hybrid_processor.py`
- **Impact**: CRITICAL - Core ECG signal processing
- **Priority**: IMMEDIATE
- **Regulatory Risk**: HIGH - FDA/ANVISA/NMSA/EU compliance

### 2. ECG Service Layer (262 statements - 0% coverage)
- **File**: `app/services/ecg_service.py`
- **Impact**: CRITICAL - Primary ECG analysis service
- **Priority**: IMMEDIATE
- **Regulatory Risk**: HIGH - Medical device validation

### 3. ECG Repository (165 statements - 0% coverage)
- **File**: `app/repositories/ecg_repository.py`
- **Impact**: HIGH - Data persistence layer
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Regulatory Risk**: MEDIUM - Data integrity

### 4. Signal Quality Analysis (153 statements - 0% coverage)
- **File**: `app/utils/signal_quality.py`
- **Impact**: HIGH - Signal validation
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Regulatory Risk**: HIGH - Quality assurance

## Low Coverage Critical Services

### 1. Hybrid ECG Service (10% coverage - 738/816 missed)
- **File**: `app/services/hybrid_ecg_service.py`
- **Current**: 78 statements covered
- **Missing**: 738 statements
- **Potential Gain**: +13.9% coverage if fully tested
- **Priority**: CRITICAL

### 2. ML Model Service (22% coverage - 216/276 missed)
- **File**: `app/services/ml_model_service.py`
- **Current**: 60 statements covered
- **Missing**: 216 statements
- **Potential Gain**: +4.1% coverage if fully tested
- **Priority**: HIGH

### 3. Validation Service (13% coverage - 227/262 missed)
- **File**: `app/services/validation_service.py`
- **Current**: 35 statements covered
- **Missing**: 227 statements
- **Potential Gain**: +4.3% coverage if fully tested
- **Priority**: HIGH

## Coverage Gap Strategy

### Phase 1: Zero Coverage Modules (Target: +28.5% coverage)
1. **ecg_hybrid_processor.py**: 381 statements → +7.2% coverage
2. **ecg_service.py**: 262 statements → +4.9% coverage
3. **ecg_repository.py**: 165 statements → +3.1% coverage
4. **signal_quality.py**: 153 statements → +2.9% coverage
5. **API endpoints**: 445 statements → +8.4% coverage
6. **Schemas**: 468 statements → +8.8% coverage

### Phase 2: Low Coverage High-Impact (Target: +22.3% coverage)
1. **hybrid_ecg_service.py**: 738 missed → +13.9% coverage
2. **ml_model_service.py**: 216 missed → +4.1% coverage
3. **validation_service.py**: 227 missed → +4.3% coverage

### Phase 3: Remaining Modules (Target: +11.2% coverage)
1. **notification_service.py**: 179 missed → +3.4% coverage
2. **Other repositories**: 149 missed → +2.8% coverage
3. **Utility modules**: 260 missed → +4.9% coverage

## Immediate Action Plan

### Priority 1: Create Comprehensive Tests for Zero Coverage Modules
- Focus on `ecg_hybrid_processor.py` (381 statements)
- Implement `ecg_service.py` tests (262 statements)
- Add `ecg_repository.py` coverage (165 statements)
- Test `signal_quality.py` methods (153 statements)

### Priority 2: Enhance Existing Low Coverage Tests
- Improve `hybrid_ecg_service.py` from 10% to 80%
- Boost `ml_model_service.py` from 22% to 80%
- Enhance `validation_service.py` from 13% to 80%

### Priority 3: API and Schema Coverage
- Implement comprehensive API endpoint tests
- Add schema validation tests
- Cover remaining utility modules

## Expected Coverage Impact

| Phase | Target Modules | Expected Gain | Cumulative Coverage |
|-------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Current | - | - | 18% |
| Phase 1 | Zero coverage | +28.5% | 46.5% |
| Phase 2 | Low coverage | +22.3% | 68.8% |
| Phase 3 | Remaining | +11.2% | 80%+ |

## Regulatory Compliance Roadmap

### FDA/ANVISA/NMSA/EU Requirements
- **Current Status**: NON-COMPLIANT (18% < 80%)
- **Phase 1 Target**: 46.5% coverage
- **Phase 2 Target**: 68.8% coverage
- **Final Target**: 80%+ compliance

## Next Steps for Step 037
1. Create targeted tests for zero coverage modules
2. Implement comprehensive method testing
3. Focus on critical medical device validation paths
4. Ensure regulatory compliance requirements are met
