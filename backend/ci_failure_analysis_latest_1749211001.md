# CI Failure Analysis - Latest Backend Tests Job 43612646103

## Summary
- **Status**: FAILED
- **Collection Errors**: 1 file with duplicate @pytest.fixture decorator
- **Tests Collected**: 743 items / 1 error
- **Root Cause**: Persistent duplicate @pytest.fixture decorator in test_coverage_maximizer.py

## Critical Error Blocking Test Collection

### test_coverage_maximizer.py
- **Error**: `ValueError: @pytest.fixture is being applied more than once to the same function 'mock_all_dependencies'`
- **Line**: 26
- **Impact**: Blocks collection of all coverage maximizer tests
- **Status**: PERSISTENT - Error message still references old function name despite rename

## Analysis
The error message indicates that pytest is still detecting a duplicate decorator on 'mock_all_dependencies' even though:
1. The function was renamed to 'mock_dependencies' 
2. Only one @pytest.fixture decorator is visible in the file
3. Previous duplicate decorator removal scripts were executed

## Potential Root Causes
1. **Cached bytecode**: Python may be using cached .pyc files with old function names
2. **Hidden characters**: Invisible Unicode characters causing duplicate decorator detection
3. **File encoding issues**: Mixed encoding causing parsing problems
4. **Git merge artifacts**: Unresolved merge conflicts creating duplicate content

## Immediate Actions Required
1. Completely recreate the test_coverage_maximizer.py file from scratch
2. Clear Python cache files (.pyc, __pycache__)
3. Verify file encoding is UTF-8
4. Use different fixture name to avoid any cached references

## Priority Level: CRITICAL
This single collection error blocks execution of 743 test items and prevents coverage analysis required for regulatory compliance.

## Next Steps
1. Delete and recreate test_coverage_maximizer.py with clean content
2. Use completely different fixture names
3. Commit and push to trigger fresh CI run
4. Monitor for successful test collection
