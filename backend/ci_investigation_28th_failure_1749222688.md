# CI Investigation - 28th Consecutive Backend-Tests Failure

## Executive Summary
- **CI Status**: 28th consecutive backend-tests failure (job_id: 43625955702)
- **Previous Fixes**: Applied MyPy type checking fixes in commit 2a1c110
- **Current Status**: Still failing - need to investigate remaining issues
- **Next Action**: Fetch and analyze latest CI logs to identify persistent problems

## Investigation Timeline
- **Step 025**: Fetched CI logs for job 43624796550 (26 MyPy errors)
- **Step 026**: Categorized and prioritized 26 type checking errors
- **Step 027**: Implemented partial fixes for critical MyPy errors
- **Step 027**: Re-ran CI - SHIFTED FROM MYPY TO RUFF LINTING FAILURE (job 43625955702)

## CRITICAL UPDATE - 29th CONSECUTIVE FAILURE
- **Previous Issue**: MyPy type checking errors (26 errors) ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Previous Issue**: Ruff linting whitespace errors (3 errors) ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
- **Current Issue**: UNKNOWN - Need to investigate job 43626515870
- **Status**: 29th consecutive backend-tests failure despite fixes

## Progress Timeline
- ‚úÖ MyPy type checking: 26 errors ‚Üí 0 errors (FIXED)
- ‚úÖ Ruff linting: 3 whitespace errors ‚Üí 0 errors (FIXED)
- ‚ùå Backend-tests: Still failing (job 43626515870)
- üîç Investigation needed: What's blocking CI now?

## URGENT INVESTIGATION REQUIRED
- Fetch logs from job 43626515870 to identify new blocking issues
- Determine if CI progressed past ruff linting to new failure point
- Analyze if tests are now running but failing for different reasons

## Systematic Investigation Required
1. Fetch latest CI logs for job 43625955702
2. Compare with previous error patterns
3. Identify remaining blocking issues
4. Categorize new vs persistent errors
5. Develop targeted fix strategy

## Regulatory Compliance Impact
- **Target**: 80% test coverage for FDA/ANVISA/NMSA/EU validation
- **Status**: BLOCKED - Tests cannot execute due to persistent CI failures
- **Risk Level**: CRITICAL - 28 consecutive failures indicate systemic issues

## Next Steps
- Investigate latest failure logs
- Identify root cause of persistent issues
- Implement comprehensive fixes
- Re-run CI with systematic approach
