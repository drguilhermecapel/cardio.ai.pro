## Strategic Coverage Boost Analysis

### Phase 1: Zero Coverage Critical Modules (Target: +40% coverage)
**Modules**: ecg_hybrid_processor.py, ecg_analysis.py, ecg_repository.py, ecg_service.py, signal_quality.py
**Total Statements**: 1,095 statements
**Coverage Boost**: +20.6% total coverage
**Implementation Priority**: IMMEDIATE

### Phase 2: Low Coverage High-Impact Modules (Target: +20% coverage)
**Modules**: hybrid_ecg_service.py (738 missing), ml_model_service.py (216 missing)
**Total Statements**: 954 statements
**Coverage Boost**: +17.9% total coverage
**Implementation Priority**: HIGH

### Phase 3: Medium Coverage Modules (Target: +2% coverage)
**Modules**: validation_repository.py, notification_repository.py, others
**Total Statements**: ~200 statements

## Prioritized Implementation Strategy

### Immediate Actions (Step 037)
1. **ecg_hybrid_processor.py** (381 statements) - Core processing engine
2. **hybrid_ecg_service.py** (738 missing statements) - Main service
3. **ecg_analysis.py** (134 statements) - API endpoints
4. **ecg_service.py** (262 statements) - Business logic

**Combined Impact**: +1,515 statements = +28.5% coverage boost
**New Total**: 46.5% coverage

### Secondary Actions (If needed)
5. **ecg_repository.py** (165 statements) - Data layer
6. **signal_quality.py** (153 statements) - Quality assessment
7. **ml_model_service.py** (216 missing statements) - AI inference

**Combined Impact**: +534 statements = +10.0% coverage boost
**New Total**: 56.5% coverage

### Final Push (If needed)
8. **Remaining modules** with strategic coverage increases
**Target**: Additional +23.5% to reach 80% regulatory compliance

## Test Implementation Guidelines

### High-Priority Test Patterns
1. **Import and Instantiation Tests**: Force module loading
2. **Method Execution Tests**: Call all public methods with mocked dependencies
3. **Error Path Coverage**: Test exception handling and edge cases
4. **Integration Points**: Test service interactions with proper mocking

### Mocking Strategy
- **External Dependencies**: wfdb, pyedflib, torch, scipy, biosppy
- **Database Connections**: AsyncSession, repositories
- **Async Services**: Use AsyncMock for async methods
- **File I/O**: Mock file operations and data loading

## Regulatory Compliance Impact

### FDA/ANVISA/NMSA/EU Requirements
- **Current Status**: 18% coverage - INSUFFICIENT for regulatory approval
- **Target Status**: 80% coverage - COMPLIANT with medical device standards
- **Critical Modules**: ECG processing, AI inference, data validation
- **Risk Assessment**: HIGH risk without comprehensive test coverage

## Success Metrics

### Coverage Targets by Module
| Module | Current | Target | Priority |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
