# CI Analysis Report - Step 028 Implementation Phase

## Executive Summary
- **Current Status**: Backend-tests still failing after ruff linting fixes
- **Job ID**: 43618407316 (failure)
- **Previous Fixes Applied**: Function redefinitions, unused variables, type annotations
- **Next Phase**: Analyze remaining failure patterns and implement targeted corrections

## CI Status Overview
- ✅ **frontend-tests**: PASS
- ✅ **docker-build**: PASS  
- ✅ **security-scan**: PASS
- ❌ **backend-tests**: FAIL (Job ID: 43618407316)
- ⏭️ **integration-tests**: SKIPPED

## Investigation Progress
### Phase 1: Ruff Linting Issues ✅ RESOLVED
- Fixed function redefinitions in validation_repository.py
- Removed unused variables (`root`, `lead_scores`)
- Corrected type annotations (dict → dict[str, Any])
- Verified all ruff checks pass locally

### Phase 2: Current CI Failure Analysis 🔄 IN PROGRESS
- **Objective**: Fetch and analyze latest CI logs from Job ID 43618407316
- **Expected Issues**: Test execution failures, import errors, or timeout issues
- **Target**: Identify specific blockers preventing test completion

## Regulatory Compliance Impact
- **Target**: 80% test coverage for FDA/ANVISA/NMSA/EU validation
- **Status**: Blocked by CI failures - cannot assess coverage until tests execute
- **Risk Level**: HIGH - Regulatory compliance validation cannot proceed

## Next Actions Based on Log Analysis
1. **If Import Errors**: Fix missing dependencies or incorrect import paths
2. **If Test Failures**: Correct method signatures and mock configurations  
3. **If Timeout Issues**: Optimize test execution for CI infrastructure
4. **If Syntax Errors**: Apply additional syntax corrections

## Files Ready for Additional Fixes
- app/services/hybrid_ecg_service.py (already partially fixed)
- app/utils/signal_quality.py (already partially fixed)
- app/repositories/validation_repository.py (already partially fixed)
- Additional modules as identified in CI logs

## Success Criteria for Step 028
- ✅ Fetch latest CI failure logs
- 🔄 Analyze specific failure patterns
- 🔄 Implement targeted fixes for identified issues
- 🔄 Re-run CI to verify fixes
- 🔄 Achieve test execution progress toward 80% coverage

## Monitoring Status
🔄 **STEP 028 ACTIVE** - Fetching latest CI logs for targeted fix implementation
