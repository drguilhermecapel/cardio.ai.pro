# Step 034 Completion: Coverage Report Verification

## Summary
Successfully verified the current test coverage status for CardioAI Pro backend, confirming significant gap from 80% regulatory compliance target.

## Coverage Verification Results

### Current Coverage Status
- **Total Coverage**: 18% (17.90%)
- **Target Coverage**: 80% (regulatory requirement)
- **Coverage Gap**: 62% remaining to reach compliance
- **Total Statements**: 5,325
- **Missed Statements**: 4,372

### Regulatory Compliance Status: NON-COMPLIANT
- **FDA Requirements**: ❌ Below 80% threshold
- **ANVISA Standards**: ❌ Below 80% threshold  
- **NMSA Compliance**: ❌ Below 80% threshold
- **EU Regulations**: ❌ Below 80% threshold

### Coverage Analysis Summary
The verification confirms that despite implementing multiple comprehensive test suites in step 037, the current coverage remains significantly below the 80% regulatory compliance threshold required for medical device validation.

### Key Findings
1. **Coverage Insufficient**: 18% coverage is far below the 80% regulatory requirement
2. **Additional Tests Required**: Significant additional test implementation needed
3. **Gap Analysis Needed**: Must identify specific modules requiring targeted testing
4. **Regulatory Risk**: Current coverage level prevents FDA/ANVISA/NMSA/EU compliance

### Next Steps Required
Based on the coverage verification results showing coverage < 80%, the next step is to:
- **Step 036**: Identify remaining coverage gaps
- Focus on modules with zero coverage and highest statement counts
- Prioritize critical medical device validation modules
- Implement targeted tests for maximum coverage impact

## Completion Status
✅ Coverage report successfully executed
✅ Current coverage percentage confirmed (18%)
✅ Coverage compared to 80% target threshold
✅ Determined additional tests are needed (coverage < 80%)
✅ Confirmed regulatory compliance requirements NOT met
✅ Identified need to proceed to step 036 for gap analysis

**Step 034 COMPLETED**: Coverage verification confirmed 18% coverage, requiring transition to step 036 for remaining coverage gap identification.
