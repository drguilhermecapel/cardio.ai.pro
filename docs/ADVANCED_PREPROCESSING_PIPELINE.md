# Advanced ECG Preprocessing Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the advanced ECG preprocessing pipeline for the CardioAI Pro system. The pipeline implements state-of-the-art signal processing techniques to improve diagnostic precision and reduce false positives in ECG analysis.

## Scientific Foundation

The advanced preprocessing pipeline is based on peer-reviewed research and clinical validation studies, implementing techniques that have been proven to improve ECG signal quality and diagnostic accuracy:

- **Signal Quality Improvement**: Target >15% improvement in signal quality metrics
- **False Positive Reduction**: Target >30% reduction in false positive diagnoses  
- **R-peak Detection Accuracy**: Target >99.5% accuracy in R-peak detection
- **Processing Efficiency**: Real-time processing with <100ms latency

## Architecture Overview

The advanced preprocessing pipeline consists of five main stages:

```
Raw ECG Signal → Filtering → Denoising → R-peak Detection → Segmentation → Normalization → Clean Signal
```

### Core Components

1. **AdvancedECGPreprocessor** (`app/preprocessing/advanced_pipeline.py`)
   - Main preprocessing orchestrator
   - Implements all signal processing stages
   - Provides quality assessment and fallback mechanisms

2. **EnhancedSignalQualityAnalyzer** (`app/preprocessing/enhanced_quality_analyzer.py`)
   - Real-time signal quality assessment
   - Multi-metric quality scoring
   - Artifact detection and characterization

## Preprocessing Techniques

### 1. Butterworth Bandpass Filtering

**Purpose**: Remove baseline wander and high-frequency noise while preserving ECG morphology.

**Implementation**:
```python
def _butterworth_bandpass_filter(self, signal_data, low_freq=0.5, high_freq=40, fs=360):
    """
    Apply 4th-order Butterworth bandpass filter (0.5-40 Hz)
    """
    nyquist = fs / 2
    low = low_freq / nyquist
    high = high_freq / nyquist
    b, a = signal.butter(4, [low, high], btype='band')
    return signal.filtfilt(b, a, signal_data)
```

**Scientific Rationale**:
- 0.5 Hz high-pass: Removes baseline wander and respiratory artifacts
- 40 Hz low-pass: Preserves QRS morphology while removing muscle noise
- Zero-phase filtering: Maintains temporal relationships in ECG waveforms

### 2. Wavelet Denoising

**Purpose**: Advanced artifact removal using multi-resolution analysis.

**Implementation**:
- **Wavelet**: Daubechies 6 (db6) - optimal for ECG signal characteristics
- **Decomposition Levels**: 9 levels for comprehensive frequency analysis
- **Thresholding**: Adaptive soft thresholding using MAD estimation

```python
def _wavelet_artifact_removal(self, signal_data):
    """
    Remove artifacts using Wavelet Daubechies db6 with adaptive thresholding
    """
    coeffs = pywt.wavedec(signal_data, 'db6', level=9)
    coeffs_thresh = []
    for i, c in enumerate(coeffs):
        if i == 0:  # Preserve approximation coefficients
            coeffs_thresh.append(c)
        else:
            sigma = np.median(np.abs(c)) / 0.6745
            threshold = sigma * np.sqrt(2 * np.log(len(c)))
            coeffs_thresh.append(pywt.threshold(c, threshold, mode='soft'))
    return pywt.waverec(coeffs_thresh, 'db6')
```

**Scientific Rationale**:
- Multi-resolution analysis separates signal from noise at different frequency scales
- Soft thresholding preserves signal continuity
- MAD-based threshold estimation is robust to outliers

### 3. Enhanced Pan-Tompkins R-peak Detection

**Purpose**: Accurate R-peak detection with >99.5% accuracy for heart rate analysis.

**Key Improvements**:
- **Enhanced Derivative Filter**: 5-point derivative for better QRS detection
- **Adaptive Thresholding**: Percentile-based thresholds instead of fixed values
- **Multi-stage Validation**: Duplicate removal, physiological validation, amplitude checking

```python
def _pan_tompkins_detector(self, signal_data, fs):
    """
    Enhanced Pan-Tompkins algorithm with >99.5% accuracy target
    """
    # 1. Bandpass filter (5-15 Hz for QRS enhancement)
    # 2. Enhanced 5-point derivative filter
    # 3. Squaring for emphasis
    # 4. Moving window integration
    # 5. Adaptive thresholding with percentile-based thresholds
    # 6. Peak refinement in original signal
    # 7. Post-processing validation
```

**Validation Steps**:
1. **Duplicate Removal**: Remove peaks within 100ms of each other
2. **Physiological Validation**: Ensure minimum 300ms RR intervals
3. **Amplitude Validation**: Remove peaks with amplitude <30% of median

### 4. Adaptive Segmentation

**Purpose**: Prepare ECG data for analysis using appropriate segmentation strategy.

**Modes**:
- **Clinical Mode**: Fixed 10-second windows for standard clinical analysis
- **Beat-by-Beat Mode**: Individual heartbeat extraction for detailed morphology analysis

```python
def _fixed_window_segmentation(self, signal_data, window_seconds=10):
    """Fixed window segmentation for clinical mode"""
    
def _beat_by_beat_segmentation(self, signal_data, r_peaks, samples_per_beat=400):
    """Beat-by-beat segmentation based on R-peak locations"""
```

### 5. Robust Normalization

**Purpose**: Standardize signal amplitude while being resistant to outliers.

**Method**: Median/IQR normalization
```python
def _robust_normalize(self, segments, method='median_iqr'):
    """
    Robust normalization using median and IQR for outlier resistance
    """
    median_val = np.median(signal)
    q75, q25 = np.percentile(signal, [75, 25])
    iqr = q75 - q25
    normalized = (signal - median_val) / iqr
```

**Advantages**:
- Resistant to amplitude outliers and artifacts
- Preserves relative signal morphology
- Suitable for multi-lead ECG normalization

## Signal Quality Assessment

### Real-time Quality Metrics

The `EnhancedSignalQualityAnalyzer` provides comprehensive quality assessment:

1. **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**: Power-based SNR estimation
2. **Baseline Stability**: Variance-based baseline wander assessment
3. **Amplitude Consistency**: Coefficient of variation analysis
4. **Frequency Domain Quality**: ECG band power ratio (0.5-40 Hz)

### Quality Scoring

```python
def _assess_signal_quality_realtime(self, signal_data):
    """
    Real-time signal quality assessment with 95% efficiency target
    """
    quality_factors = [snr_score, baseline_score, amplitude_consistency, freq_quality]
    weights = [0.3, 0.25, 0.25, 0.2]
    overall_quality = sum(w * f for w, f in zip(weights, quality_factors))
    return min(max(overall_quality, 0.0), 1.0)
```

## Integration with Existing System

### HybridECGAnalysisService Integration

The advanced preprocessing pipeline is integrated into the existing `HybridECGAnalysisService` with backward compatibility:

```python
# Advanced preprocessing with quality assessment
processed_signal, quality_metrics = self.advanced_preprocessor.advanced_preprocessing_pipeline(
    signal, clinical_mode=True
)

# Comprehensive quality analysis
comprehensive_quality = self.quality_analyzer.assess_signal_quality_comprehensive(processed_signal)

# Fallback mechanism for quality assurance
if quality_metrics['quality_score'] < 0.5:
    logger.warning("Advanced preprocessing quality too low, falling back to standard preprocessing")
    preprocessed_signal = self.preprocessor.preprocess_signal(signal)
else:
    preprocessed_signal = processed_signal
```

### Compatibility Features

1. **Interface Compatibility**: Maintains same input/output format as existing preprocessor
2. **Graceful Fallback**: Automatically falls back to standard preprocessing if quality is insufficient
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with logging
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in timing and quality metrics

### Data Flow

```
ECG Input → Advanced Preprocessing → Quality Check → Feature Extraction → ML Analysis
     ↓                                    ↓
Standard Preprocessing ←── Quality Too Low
```
